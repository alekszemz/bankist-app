<p>The <strong>banking application</strong> features an <strong>online banking interface</strong> that has been written using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS)</strong>. When you first land on the homepage, it appears to be quite empty until you log in using fake user initials and a pin number. The first user's initials are "js" and the pin is "1111", while the second user's initials are "jd" and the pin is "2222".</p>
<p>Once logged in, the application offers a variety of options such as <strong>transferring money</strong>, <strong>paying bills</strong>, <strong>requesting a loan</strong>, and even the option to <strong>close your account</strong>. All transactions are updated in real-time, ensuring that you have the most up-to-date information available. Additionally, the application includes the current date and a logout timer in case the user is inactive for a long period of time.</p>
<p>This application was created by learning JavaScript from the online course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021 From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. If you're interested in seeing the application in action, you can find it live at the following link: <a href="https://alekszemz.github.io/bankist-app/">https://alekszemz.github.io/bankist-app/</a>.</p>
